# Attendance-Tracker

Automation of attendance for Senate meetings at Northeastern's Graduate Student Government using pandas.
Data from excel sheets of eventbrite and zoom meetings are fed into the system.
For zoom participants, based on the set conditions like total meeting duration a participant was logged in and their last leave time, a person will be marked present automatically.
A new excel file would then be generated, with attendance data from zoom and Eventbrite, having role details as well (Senator, E-Board member and Member).

To run in your system, install Python and clone the git repo and run it.
